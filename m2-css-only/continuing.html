            a) The basic about colors <em>in the web</em>
        </h2>
            <p>
                In the Web colors are displayed in the monitors combining RED, GREEN, and BLUE light. That's where the name RGB (colors) come from.
            </p>
            <P>
                <q><em>sRGB is a standard RGB (red, green, blue) color space that HP and Microsoft created cooperatively in 1996 to use on monitors, printers, and the World Wide Web.[2] It was subsequently standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as IEC 61966-2-1:1999.[1] sRGB is the current defined standard colorspace for the web, and it is usually the assumed colorspace for images that are neither tagged for a colorspace nor have an embedded color profile</em>.</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia RGB</a>
            </P>
            <P>
                So RGB is the standard but you can <em>talk</em> about RGB colors with your computer in other <q>languages</q>. In other words, you can set CSS colors either naming ther by their Red, Green and Blue values or by any other numeric patterns your computer can understand as colors in a CSS selector (hexadecimal, for instance, is very used).
            </P>
    
            <P>
                But colors may attend by their names too.
            </P>
            <P>
                All modern browsers support the following 140 color names: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please, it's better to check them at w3schools.</a>
            </P>
            <P>
                If you want to go deeper in the RGB universe, like:

                Then you can read all the Wikipedia article mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you've had enough for while, you may stick to those ONE MILLION colors you can use with this lesson and see all of them at once right here:

        <h2>
            b) The basic about colors <em>in CSS</em>
        </h2>

            <p>
                As we saw in the <a href="../content\css-intro.html">CSS Intro page</a>, all the 3 ways of implementing CSS into your page are somehow preceded by the word "style" or "stylesheet".
            </p>

            <p>
                So, when you're in a "style" environment, which means a CSS environment, the most common forms of applying colors is through both "color" (changes the color of the text) and "background-color" (the name says it all) properties of the CSS declaration. Let's check how it fits in the 3 ways of CSS:
            </p>

            <h4>
                Internal CSS:
            </h4>

            <img src="assets/css-color-internal.png" width="70%" alt="css-color-internal example">

            <h4>
                Inline CSS:
            </h4>

            <img src="assets/css-color-inline.png" width="70%" alt="css-color-inline example">

            <h4>
                External CSS:
            </h4>
                This is the HTML SIDE of the external CSS (a link mentioning <q>stylesheet</q> that leads to a separate <q>.css</q> extention file):
            <img src="assets/css-color-external-1.png" width="80%"  alt="css-color-external-html side">

            <p>
                And this is the CSS SIDE of the external CSS:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/css-color-external-2.png" width="40%" alt="css-color-external-CSS side">


        <h2>
            1.1) Color palette
        </h2>
            <P>
                In color theory, a color scheme (or palette) is the choice of colors used in various artistic and design contexts. For example, the "Achromatic" use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design. Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color schemes. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia - Color_scheme</a>)</P>
            <p>
                You may not realize but every graphic design you see, be it a website or an advertising and even a movie, has its color palette. And it is used to make you feel something. We'll see the psychological effect of colors later in the course. But if you are curous about it, just check this <a href="http://www.oberlo.com/blog/color-psychology-color-meanings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article by Nicole Martins Ferreira: "How color meanings affect your brand"</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To build your own color pallete you may first go to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/color-wheel" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Colors.</a> The color wheel (or image in the Extract Theme tab) can be used to generate a color palette, which appear below the wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left side of the page you can choose among ten color harmony rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any time you can move the small balls in the color wheel to choose your own hue and saturation for each color rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under each color rectangle below the color wheel is its hexadecimal code, which an be copied and pasted directly on your css code.
            </p>

        <h2>
            1.2) Picking a color from screen
        </h2>
            <p>
                To pick a color or a theme you like from any image you have in your device just open the same Adobe Colors as above linked and choose the "Extract Theme" tab. The screen will be the following:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/colors-extract.jpg" width="90%" alt="How to extract theme from Adobe Colors website.">

            <p>
                Once you get there, put an image file into the center rectangle, as directed.

            </p>

            <p>
                If your target image is a website, just make a "print screen" from that page and submit the image as directed.
            </p>

            <p>
                See the test I made with a watercolor by my friend José Guyer Salles:
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/colors-extracted.jpg" width="90%"  alt="Color theme extracted  from Adobe Colors website.">

            <p>
                Again:
            </p>

            <p>
                At any time you can move the small balls in the color wheel to choose the colors you want to pick, if different from what was automatically done.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under each color rectangle below the color wheel is its hexadecimal code, which an be copied and pasted directly on your css code.


        <h2>
            1.3) Making a CSS gradient
        </h2>
            <p>
                First let's make a 500 pixels high <q>div</q> we can work with background colors inside.
            </p>

            <h3>
                A word about the <q>div</q>
            </h3>

            <p>
                First: neither <q>div</q> nor <q>span</q> are semantic. Avoid them.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, instead of making a <q>div</q> I'll make an <q>article</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                If the width is not set, the browsers assume that it's 100% wide (margins left and right = zero).
            </p>

            <p>
                If a width is set, a <q>margin: auto;</q> CSS centralizes it. Check a real example and its code below:
            </p>

                <article class="gradient">

                    <img src="assets/gradient-css-code.png" width="50%" alt="gradient code.">

                    <p>
                        The article class is called <q>gradient</q> and displays a bonus violet <q>box-shadow</q>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a radial gradient from white to blue. There are other forms to do it, like linear in several directions (including directions in degrees, like "45deg" - positive or negative - for instance), repeating linear and repeating radial. VS Code's Emmet gives you almost all those options when you start writing <q>background-image</q> in the CSS area/file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To each color of the gradient a percentage can be attributed right after its name (or value) so it accupies more space or less space in the gradient.
                    </p>

        2) Typography
    </h1>
            <p>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and <strong>appealing</strong> when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), as well as adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.</blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                The above quotation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wikipedia</a> gives us a hint that, as well as colors, typefaces can cause some level of emotios, feelings, to the reader. And continuing with Wikipedia:
            </p>
    
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                Typography has long been a vital part of promotional material and advertising. Designers often use typefaces to set a theme and mood in an advertisement (for example, using bold, large text to convey a particular message to the reader).[49] Choice of typeface is often used to draw attention to a particular advertisement, combined with efficient use of color, shapes, and images. Today, typography in advertising often reflects a company's brand.
                </p>
                <p>A brand may use typography to express its theme, personality, and message. Just by looking at the typeface, viewers can get an idea about the message and personality of the brand, which the brands are fully aware of and are tapping into the power of good typography.
                </p>
                <p>Typefaces used in advertisements convey different messages to the reader: classical ones are for a strong personality, while more modern ones may convey clean, neutral look. Bold typefaces are used for making statements and attracting attention. In any design, a balance has to be achieved between the visual impact and communication aspects. Digital technology in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has enabled the creation of typefaces for advertising that are more experimental than traditional typefaces.

        <h2>2.1) How to choose <em>fonts</em> in css</h2>

            <p>
                As you must have noticed in your previous experience with text softwares, a kind of letter is called <q>font</q>. In fact it's been called font since 1995, according to the Wikipedia article above.
            </p>
    
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">
                This paragraph is written in a different font family as the rest of the page. And it is applied with <em>inline CSS</em> as follows:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/font-family-code-inline.png" width="70%" alt="font-family-code-inline">

            <p>
                As all the other CSS style effects, you may choose to apply it by <em>inline or internal or external</em> CSS
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that when the font family name is composed of more than one word, it must be between quotes,like the "Arial Narrow Bold" in the above code snippet.
            </p>

            <p>There are always 3 types of font in each Emmet suggestion. It's called a
                <q>safe combination</q> that provides options to a certain device (mobile, tablet, Smart TV, PC, you name it) in case it doesn't have one of the chosen. In that case, a very similar one will be used.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you don't mind which particular font will be used, you may always choose <q>serif</q> or <q>sans-serif</q> as a font family and there will be no mistake. Every device must have at least one of each kind to display.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course all the styles you already apply in MS Word are available here, like <em>italic</em> (made with the &lt;em&gt; tag) and <strong>bold</strong> (made with the &lt;srtong&gt; tag). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Underline is made with <q><code>text-decoration: underline;</code></q> simple declaration in the internal and external CSS. <br>
                But to make it inline, there must be a &lt;span&gt; tag, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">like here.</span>
            </p>

            <img src="assets/underline.png" width="100%" alt="underline">

            <p>
                But the above works better in one word or a few words. To make it in block (like all the paragraphs, all the h1 titles, the whole page, a group of paragraphs or one paragraph) its better to make it CSS internal or external, like this:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/font-style.png" width="50%" alt="font-style">

            <p>
                To make a shorthand (to use 1 line instead of 4) of the above just declare <code>font:</code> and put the properties in the following order: <br>
                <code>style weight size family</code>
            </p>
            <p>Like that:</p>

            <p>
                <code>font: italic bolder 2em 'Courrier New'</code>
            </p>

            <p>Note: you don't have to declare all the 4 properties, but you must mantain the same order, even skipping some of them.</p>
            
            <p>
                Don't forget:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Style</li>
                <li>Weight</li>
                <li>Size</li>
                <li>Family</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>
            2.2.4) Font family options
        </h3>

            <p>
                At <a href="http://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fonts.google.com</a> you have a lot of font options to use (more than 1,300!!!). Once you choose a font, you can download, embed or import the font. The last option is the most practical. Just copy the given code and insert it into the first lines of the CSS space (outside any selectors) of your website or page to be used where you want, as if it was installed in your device. You must be connected to the web, though. You can do it with as many fonts as you like in the same website's CSS space/file.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the teacher says, there are other websites that do the same but he likes Google Fonts. And, of course, it's free to use.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember always to declare, at the end of the font family line, the general type, I mean, <em>serif</em> or <em>sans-serif</em>, just in case anything else works for any reason.
            </p>

        <h3>
            2.2.5) The <code>@font-face</code> Rule (CSS) and the font-family property (HTML)
        </h3>

            <p>
                With CSS, websites can finally use fonts other than the pre selected "web-safe" fonts.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>a) To use a new font in the CSS area:</strong> After you download a font to your website folder (a folder of your choice), just declare the font name (suppose it's <em>"Open Sans"</em>) and the URL where it can be found (remember it's already in a folder of your choice and suppose it's called <q>fonts</q>):
                <pre>
                    @font-face {
                        font-family: "Open Sans";
                        src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"),
                             url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");
                      }
                </pre>

                It's part of the syntax to declare the format after the url, like above. The file type is repeated inside the parenthesis: <span style="color: red;"><em>format("woff2")</em>
                </span>. It's better to check if the format really equals the file type.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>b) To use the font for an HTML element:</strong> refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:
                <pre>
                    div {
                        font-family: myFirstFont;
                      }
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: With <q>Fonts Ninja</q> extention, obtained at Chrome Web Store, you can discover what kind of font is that you liked in someone else's web page.
            </p>

                And at <a href="http://www.whatfontis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whatfontis.com</a> you can discover what kind of fonts are used in any illustration, any picture.

        <h2>
            3.1) Text-align
        </h2>

            <p>
                The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the content inside a block element or table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Syntax:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>start</strong>:
                The same as left if direction is left-to-right and right if direction is right-to-left.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>end</strong>:
                The same as right if direction is left-to-right and left if direction is right-to-left.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>left</strong>:
                The inline contents are aligned to the left edge of the line box.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>right</strong>:
                The inline contents are aligned to the right edge of the line box.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>center</strong>:
                The inline contents are centered within the line box.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>justify</strong>:
                The inline contents are justified. Text should be spaced to line up its left and right edges to the left and right edges of the line box, except for the last line.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>justify-all</strong> :
                Same as justify, but also forces the last line to be justified.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>match-parent</strong>:
                Similar to inherit, but the values start and end are calculated according to the parent's direction and are replaced by the appropriate left or right value.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>&lt;string&gt;</strong>:
                When applied to a table cell, specifies the alignment character around which the cell's contents will align.

            <p>
                <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> are perzonalizable selectors.
            </p>


                <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class">
                    The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the DOM* method: <br>

                </blockquote>

            <p>
                Though the specification doesn't put requirements on the <strong>name of classes</strong>, web developers are encouraged to use names that describe the semantic purpose of the element, rather than the presentation of the element. For example, <q>clarify-box</q> (to the box below)  to describe an attribute rather than only "box", although  this class may be presented by a box. Semantic names remain logical (the clarification part of it) even if the presentation of the page changes (if one day it's not a box any longer).
            </p>


            <p>
                Sometimes I may want one - <em>and only one for each id name</em> - of the many <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> in the website to have a different - let's say - font color as I had declared for all the <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> in the <strong><code>.css</code></strong> file.
            </p>

            <p>
                To do that I identify the <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> with an <strong><q>id</q></strong> selector as follows:
            </p>
            
        <h2>
            4.1) id
        </h2>

            <p>
                The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element (<em>again: one and only one!</em>), i.e. an  <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> tag. (Opposite to the <strong><q>class</q></strong> selector, that selects an area (a <strong><em>div</em></strong> or an <strong><em>article</em></strong>) or a block of elements - several <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> - for instance ).

    <h1 id="different">
        To this &lt;h1&gt;
        I attributed an <em>id</em> called <q>different</q>. 
        It must be used only here.
    </h1>

            <p>
                First I did it in the HTML file. As all the attributes, you put it in the opening tag. Look:
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/different-1.png" width="50%" alt="id code in the html file">
            
            <p>
                Note below that the <strong>id</strong> selector at the CSS file is a <strong>#</strong> (hashtag).</p>

            <p>
                In the first example below the <strong>teacher wanted to specify</strong> that the id style is directed only to that <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> tag so he wrote <q><code>h1#different</code></q> in the CSS file. As the teacher himself said later in the lesson, you don't have to do this. And I dare to add: It's <strong>COMPLETELY USELESS</strong> because each <strong>id</strong> attribute belongs to one place only. Period.
            </p>
  
            <p>
                In the <strong>.css</strong> file it looks like that:
            </p>
            

                <img src="assets/different-2.png" width="30%" alt="id code only for h1 in the CSS file">
            
            <p>
                The second example the <q>different</q> id will be valid for that tag to which it was attributed and that's enough.
            </p>

            <img src="assets/different-3.png" width="30%" alt="id code for any tag I want in the CSS file">

                Yes, it's possible. But how many?
            </p>

            <p>
                According to <a href="http://kilianvalkhof.com/2008/css-html/maximum-number-of-supported-classes-per-element/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilian Valkhof</a>, <q>I expected to find a number of 32 or something near that. Turns out I was quite mistaken, the real number, in all browsers, is well <strong>over 2000</strong> classes!</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                Example of a code with 2 classes, from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17366432/multiple-classes-on-single-element-html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stackoverflow</a>. Note that there's <strong>only a space between each class</strong>, in the HTML code.
            </p>

            <p>
                The CSS is like that:
                <pre>
                    .class1 {
                        color:red;
                    }
                    
                    .class2 {
                        background-color:blue;
                    }
                </pre>
            </p>
                And the HTML is:

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;div class="class1"&gt;text 1&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="class2"&gt;text 2&lt;/div&gt;
                    <strong>&lt;div class="class1 class2"&gt;text 3&lt;/div&gt;</strong>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                But... <strong>Is it good practice?</strong> According to the same Stackoverflow link as above:
            </p>

            <blockquote cite="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17366432/multiple-classes-on-single-element-html">
                It is a good practice since an element can be a part of different groups, and you may want specific elements to be a part of more than one group. <strong>The element can hold an infinite number of classes in HTML5</strong>.

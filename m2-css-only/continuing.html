        <h2>
            a) The basic about colors <em>in the web</em>
        </h2>
            <p>
                In the Web colors are displayed in the monitors combining RED, GREEN, and BLUE light. That's where the name RGB (colors) come from.
            </p>
            <P>
                <q><em>sRGB is a standard RGB (red, green, blue) color space that HP and Microsoft created cooperatively in 1996 to use on monitors, printers, and the World Wide Web.[2] It was subsequently standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as IEC 61966-2-1:1999.[1] sRGB is the current defined standard colorspace for the web, and it is usually the assumed colorspace for images that are neither tagged for a colorspace nor have an embedded color profile</em>.</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia RGB</a>
            </P>
            <P>
                So RGB is the standard but you can <em>talk</em> about RGB colors with your computer in other <q>languages</q>. In other words, you can set CSS colors either naming ther by their Red, Green and Blue values or by any other numeric patterns your computer can understand as colors in a CSS selector (hexadecimal, for instance, is very used).
            </P>
    
            <P>
                But colors may attend by their names too.
            </P>
            <P>
                All modern browsers support the following 140 color names: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please, it's better to check them at w3schools.</a>
            </P>
            <P>
                If you want to go deeper in the RGB universe, like:
            </P>
            <img src="assets/color-formulas.jpg" width="60%" alt="color formulas example.">
            <p>
                Then you can read all the Wikipedia article mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you've had enough for while, you may stick to those ONE MILLION colors you can use with this lesson and see all of them at once right here:

        <h2>
            b) The basic about colors <em>in CSS</em>
        </h2>

            <p>
                As we saw in the <a href="../content\css-intro.html">CSS Intro page</a>, all the 3 ways of implementing CSS into your page are somehow preceded by the word "style" or "stylesheet".
            </p>

            <p>
                So, when you're in a "style" environment, which means a CSS environment, the most common forms of applying colors is through both "color" (changes the color of the text) and "background-color" (the name says it all) properties of the CSS declaration. Let's check how it fits in the 3 ways of CSS:
            </p>

            <h4>
                Internal CSS:
            </h4>

            <img src="assets/css-color-internal.png" width="70%" alt="css-color-internal example">

            <h4>
                Inline CSS:
            </h4>

            <img src="assets/css-color-inline.png" width="70%" alt="css-color-inline example">

            <h4>
                External CSS:
            </h4>
                This is the HTML SIDE of the external CSS (a link mentioning <q>stylesheet</q> that leads to a separate <q>.css</q> extention file):
            <img src="assets/css-color-external-1.png" width="80%"  alt="css-color-external-html side">

            <p>
                And this is the CSS SIDE of the external CSS:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/css-color-external-2.png" width="40%" alt="css-color-external-CSS side">


        <h2>
            1.1) Color palette
        </h2>
            <P>
                In color theory, a color scheme (or palette) is the choice of colors used in various artistic and design contexts. For example, the "Achromatic" use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design. Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color schemes. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia - Color_scheme</a>)</P>
            <p>
                You may not realize but every graphic design you see, be it a website or an advertising and even a movie, has its color palette. And it is used to make you feel something. We'll see the psychological effect of colors later in the course. But if you are curous about it, just check this <a href="http://www.oberlo.com/blog/color-psychology-color-meanings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article by Nicole Martins Ferreira: "How color meanings affect your brand"</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To build your own color pallete you may first go to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/color-wheel" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Colors.</a> The color wheel (or image in the Extract Theme tab) can be used to generate a color palette, which appear below the wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left side of the page you can choose among ten color harmony rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any time you can move the small balls in the color wheel to choose your own hue and saturation for each color rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under each color rectangle below the color wheel is its hexadecimal code, which an be copied and pasted directly on your css code.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/colors-palette.jpg" width="90%" alt="color pallete from adobe Colors">
        <h2>
            1.2) Picking a color from screen
        </h2>
            <p>
                To pick a color or a theme you like from any image you have in your device just open the same Adobe Colors as above linked and choose the "Extract Theme" tab. The screen will be the following:
            </p>

            <img src="assets/colors-extract.jpg" width="90%" alt="How to extract theme from Adobe Colors website.">

            <p>
                Once you get there, put an image file into the center rectangle, as directed.

            </p>

            <p>
                If your target image is a website, just make a "print screen" from that page and submit the image as directed.
            </p>

            <p>
                See the test I made with a watercolor by my friend José Guyer Salles:
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/colors-extracted.jpg" width="90%"  alt="Color theme extracted  from Adobe Colors website.">

            <p>
                Again:
            </p>

            <p>
                At any time you can move the small balls in the color wheel to choose the colors you want to pick, if different from what was automatically done.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under each color rectangle below the color wheel is its hexadecimal code, which an be copied and pasted directly on your css code.


        <h2>
            1.3) Making a CSS gradient
        </h2>
            <p>
                First let's make a 500 pixels high <q>div</q> we can work with background colors inside.
            </p>

            <p>
                A word about the <q>div</q>:
            </p>

            <p>
                If the width is not set, the browsers assume that it's 100% wide (margins left and right = zero).
            </p>

            <p>
                If a width is set, a <q>margin: auto;</q> CSS centralizes it. Check a real example and its code below:
            </p>

                <div class="gradient">

                    <img src="assets/gradient-css-code.png" width="50%" alt="gradient code.">

                    <p>
                        The div class is called <q>gradient</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a radial gradient from white to blue. There are other forms to do it, like linear in several directions (including directions in degrees, like "45deg" - positive or negative - for instance), repeating linear and repeating radial. VS Code's Emmet gives you almost all those options when you start writing <q>background-image</q> in the CSS area/file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To each color of the gradient a percentage can be attributed right after its name (or value) so it accupies more space or less space in the gradient.
                    </p>

                </div>

            <p>
                And again <a href="https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/image-gradient" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Colors can help you extracting & creating a gradient from any image you like.</a>
            </p>

# HTML-CSS-Module2-Curso-em-Video
 All the M1 content in the shape of a website and CSS to the extent of the course.
 
 The content of Module 1 will be split into several pages, by subject/topic, with a left side vertical navigation bar as close as possible to the looks of w3schools' one. I liked that. It's simple and practical.
 
 The CSS will be as external as possible to standardize the website. Will check the pros and cons of that as we walk.No JavaScript is expected for this phase.
 
 The phases are:
 
<ol style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<li>PHASE 1 - Only one long page focused in HTML5 / Aware of imperfect testings of CSS / No JavaScript. </li>

<li><strong>PHASE 2</strong> - Is this you're reading: The same content, forked and completely refactored, with navigation bar and several pages showing how to apply the correct CSS3. No JavaScript.<br>
            (First deploy expected for March 20, 2022).</li>

<li>PHASE 3 - The previous phase, forked and refactored, now starting with JavaScript. <br>
            (First deploy expected for May 20, 2022).</li>
</ol>

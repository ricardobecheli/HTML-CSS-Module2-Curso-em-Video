<h1>Wrap with abbreviation (a VS Code shortcut)</h1>

            <p>To put any lenght of text (from a single letter to a group of paragraphs) inside a tag:</p>
            <p>Just press <em>Ctrl + shift + p</em> then find "wrap with abbreviation", select it with <em>enter</em> and type only the letters that represent the tag you want. Only the letters, without the &lt; and &GT; signs. And <em>enter</em> to finalize. Ready! It's wrapped. The next times you do that, just press ctrl+shift+p and the option will already be there in the recent history and you proceed with the rest of the instructions above. </p>
